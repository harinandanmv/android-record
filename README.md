# 📱 Android Development Record — An Overview

Welcome! This repository contains my **Android Development practical experiments**, created as part of my coursework.
Each experiment explores a specific **Android concept**, from simple UI creation to advanced topics like notifications, sensors, and database management.

## 💡 What This Repository Covers

This record includes **40 Android experiments and a final project**, built using **Java/Kotlin, XML, and Android Studio**.
Each experiment is designed to strengthen understanding of:

* Activity lifecycle and navigation
* Layout design and UI components
* Intents and fragment management
* Media handling and notifications
* Sensors and device services
* Data storage using SQLite and Content Providers
